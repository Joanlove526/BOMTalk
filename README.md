# BOMTalk

A rather unknown part of [GameKit](http://bit.ly/iCr99E) is its ad hoc networking between devices by means of Bluetooth or WiFi using Bonjour services. This immensly simplifies sharing data between iOS devices, but the API is unconvenient for most purposes and somehow aging, offering no clean delegate or block based callback mechanism.

This is what BOMTalk offers:

- GameKit based with support for Bluetooth and WiFi ad hoc networks
- provides either a block-based or delegate-protocol or (multicast) notifications API
- sends and receives arbitrarily sized data (NSData conforming to NSCoding)
- automatically keeps one connection slot open for up to 15 simultaneous connections per session
- hides GameKits weird delegates/class callbacks and consolidates its states
- basic network debugging view controller to analyse communication

# Examples

## Pastboard

This example sends your current pasteboard data (image or text) to another device of your choice. The receiving device will display the image or text and copies it to its own pasteboard.

## Roll the Dice

All devices will roll a random number and the one who wins will be displayed in green, the others will see a red number.

## Pong

This rough mini-game connects two player and lets them play pong against each other. With only basic UI and highscores this gives a good start for fast communication between devices in BOMTalk.

## Remote Camera

Taking a remote photo from a different iPhone can be useful (e.g. recursive photos or self-portraits without *the* arm), this APP allows you to request a photo from another iPhone in maximum quality to be sent to your device and save it to the photo album. This idea was born at [UIKonf](http://www.uikonf.com) by two attendees.

# Concepts

Sitting on top of GameKit which itself sits ontop of Bonjour and hence ontop of Bluetooth or WiFi, BOMTalk needs only two classes to interact with (BOMTalk and to a lesser extend BOMTalkPeer). All you have to do is prepare your data to be NSCoding compatible for transmission and a little "protocol":

## Your Protocol

Although BOMTalk is built to let your APPs "talk" to each other, you need to define the "language" or the "protocol" to achieve this interaction. This protocol is sometimes described by [DAGs](http://bit.ly/5UhB), a neat way to visualize the different states and the connections between them. Basically you draw circles for the states and connect them with arrows. These arrows are the messages (with optional payload/data) which are sent between devices/APPs. In BOMTalk each messages is a number (with optional payload/data) and could be as simpel as this one-direction protocol:

	              Send Photo
	[Device A] ---------------> [Device B]

Depending on your APP logic and needs you most probably add much more messages to your APP.

Testing your "protocol" can be an extremely tedious task: modelling states in APPs takes some time to figure out correctly, network connections are unreliable, they are delayed or will never arrive at all. For that reason, BOMTalk offers a basic network messaging debugger BOMTalkDebugViewController (on top of GameKit) with a timeline of appearing and disappearing peers and events/messages between those peers.

## BOMTalk, BOMTalkPeer, BOMTalkPackage

[BOMTalk]([BOMTalk]) is the primary class your controller interacts with. It's meant to be used as a singleton and encapsulates all networking and objects. Each peer, which BOMTalk connects and talks to, is held in a BOMTalkPeer class. If you like to attach additional data to a peer, use its [userInfo]([BOMTalkPeer userInfo]) dictionary for that purpose. Internally BOMTalkPackage is used to transfer data between peers but that is the least interessing class for you (generally you interact with BOMTalk 95% and 5% with BOMTalkPeer).

## Data and Progress

Apple's size recommendation to send data through GameKit is max. 50KB, but BOMTalk allows arbitrary sized NSData. In the sender BOMTalk splits the data into blocks, collects them on the receivers end and recreates the previously NSData object. Your data must adhere to the NSCoding protocol!

Sending data is completely optional: in a lot of cases, message IDs may suffice (for states, handshaking etc). If you send data and it exceeds the limit, you can be notified of the transmission for each block (not for individual bytes) with the progress API.

# Documentation

BOMTalk consolidates GameKits APIs and internal techniques by providing a BOMTalk connection "object". This object ecapsulates the network handling, keeps its list of peers up to date and interacts with your controller in three ways: blocks, delegates or notifications. Alongside the obvious [sendTo]([BOMTalk sendToAllMessage:])-messages all callback mechanisms are modelled with the same concept in mind:

- answering to incoming messages
- progess metrics for outgoing and incoming data
- callbacks for connecting to or disconnects from a peer
- general network updates

## 1. Blocks

Blocks immensly simplify your code logic in your controller. As an example (excerpt from the Remote Camera example) for sending an image between two devices, only a few lines of code are needed to send or store the image:

	// SENDER
	BOMTalk *talker = [BOMTalk sharedTalk];
	[talker startInMode:GKSessionModePeer];
	// select peer, then:
	[talker connectToPeer: peer success:^(BOMTalkPeer *peer){
		[talker sendMessage:kSendPhoto toPeer: peer withData: UIImageJPEGRepresentation(image, 1)];
	}];

	// RECEIVER
	BOMTalk *talker = [BOMTalk sharedTalk];
	[talker startInMode:GKSessionModePeer];
	[talker answerToMessage:kSendPhoto block:^(BOMTalkPeer *peer, id data) {
		UIImage *image = [[UIImage alloc] initWithData: data];
		UIImageWriteToSavedPhotosAlbum(image, nil, nil, nil);
	}];

## 2. Delegates

If you need a seperate object to react to your network messages or prefer the common delegate mechnism, you can use it with BOMTalk as well. As another example (excerpt from the Roll the Dice example) to answer to a remote request, your APP receives the request and sends data back like this:

	// SENDER
	- (void) viewDidLoad {
		BOMTalk *talker = [BOMTalk sharedTalk];
		talker.delegate = self;
		[talker startInMode:GKSessionModePeer];
	}
	- (void) talkDidConnect:(BOMTalkPeer*) peer {
		[[BOMTalk sharedTalk] sendMessage:kRollStart toPeer: peer];
	}
	- (IBAction) roll {
		[[BOMTalk sharedTalk] connectToPeer: peer];
	}

	// RECEIVER
	- (void) viewDidLoad {
		BOMTalk *talker = [BOMTalk sharedTalk];
		talker.delegate = self;
		[talker startInMode:GKSessionModePeer];
	}

	- (void) talkReceived:(NSInteger) messageID fromPeer:(BOMTalkPeer*) sender withData:(id<NSCoding>) data {
		switch (messageID) {
			case kRollStart:
				[[BOMTalk sharedTalk] sendMessage:kRollAnswer toPeer:sender withData: [NSNumber numberWithInt: random() % 100]];
			break;
		}
	}

## 3. Notifications

If you need to handle messages in multiple objects, you can use iOS notifications: add an observer to the BOMTalkNotifications with your methods to be called. As an example (excerpt form the Pong example) if you want to send data from one device to another, here is an example with notifications:

	// SENDER
	- (void) viewDidLoad {
		[[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserver:self selector:@selector(connectedTalk:) name:kBOMTalkDidConnectNotification object:nil];
		BOMTalk *talker = [BOMTalk sharedTalk];
		[talker startInMode:GKSessionModePeer];
		// select peer, then:
		[talker connectToPeer: peer];
	}
	- (void) connectedTalk: (NSNotification*) notification {
		CGPoint pos = CGPointMake(_ballView.center.x + _vector.x, _ballView.center.y + _vector.y);
		[[BOMTalk sharedTalk] sendMessage:kGameBall toPeer:notification.object withData: @{@"x": [NSNumber numberWithFloat:pos.x], @"y": [NSNumber numberWithFloat:pos.y]}];
	}

	// RECEIVER
	- (void) viewDidLoad {
		[[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserver:self selector:@selector(receivedTalk:) name:kBOMTalkReceivedNotification object:nil];
		BOMTalk *talker = [BOMTalk sharedTalk];
		[talker startInMode:GKSessionModePeer];
	}
	- (void) receivedTalk: (NSNotification*) notification {
		BOMTalkPeer *peer = notification.object[@"peer"];
		NSNumber *message = notification.object[@"messageID"];
		switch (message.integerValue) {
			case kGameBall:
				_ballView.center = CGPointMake([notification.object[@"data"][@"x"] floatValue], [notification.object[@"data"][@"y"] floatValue]);Â 
			break;
		}
	}

The three mechanisms are mutually exclusive for the same event type: e.g. for connecting devices you can either provide a block or a delegeate or receive a notifications for that event. But you can mix different event types and handle your own messages with a delegate but network message by means of notifications (although that hardly makes sense, but YMMV).
